# Coding Conventions

This project follows these coding conventions:

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any` types
- **React Components**: 
  - Function components with arrow functions
  - Props interfaces named with `Props` suffix
  - Client components marked with `.client.tsx` extension
  - Server components are the default
- **File Structure**:
  - One component per file
  - Named exports preferred over default exports
  - Related components can be co-located in feature folders
- **Naming**:
  - PascalCase for components and types
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - kebab-case for file names
- **Styling**:
  - TailwindCSS for styling with class-variance-authority when needed
  - Use `clsx` or `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes
- **Comments**: English only for code comments
- **Testing**:
  - Component tests near the components they test
  - E2E tests in the `e2e/` directory
