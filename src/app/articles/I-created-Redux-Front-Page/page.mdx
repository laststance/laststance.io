The **[Redux Front Page](https://redux-front-page.vercel.app/)** was created to solve a long-standing issue in the Redux ecosystem — fragmented documentation.

## Why I Built This

Over time, Redux has grown in both features and community, but its learning resources have become scattered:

- Multiple official and unofficial documentation sites  
- Tutorials and guides spread across blogs, forums, and social media  
- A steep learning curve due to inconsistent or outdated references  

This fragmentation has made it challenging for newcomers and experienced developers alike to find reliable, up-to-date information.

**Redux Front Page** addresses this by offering a centralized starting point — a curated, organized guide to all major parts of the Redux ecosystem and its documentation.

## Inspired by Community Voices

This initiative was sparked by valuable community feedback, especially the concerns highlighted by [Mark Erikson](https://bsky.app/profile/acemarke.dev/post/3lngz256amc27), Redux maintainer and frequent contributor to improving developer experience. His reflections on the accessibility of Redux resources resonated with many, and ultimately motivated the creation of this site.

## What’s Next

We're continuously refining the site to serve as a dependable hub for Redux knowledge — whether you’re just starting out or diving deep into advanced concepts.

If you’ve ever felt lost navigating Redux docs, I hope this makes your journey smoother.
