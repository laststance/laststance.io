Personally, I often find that blog posts announcing new versions have clearer explanations than the official documentation, and I really like them. <br/>
So, I used AI to gather links and summaries for all the version posts.

I plan to update this whenever a new version comes out.

## Announcing TypeScript 5.8

- **Date**: 2025-02-28
- **Summary**: This release introduces several new features and improvements:
  - **Granular Checks for Branches in Return Expressions**: TypeScript now performs more thorough checks on conditional expressions in return statements to catch subtle bugs.
  - **Support for `require()` of ECMAScript Modules**: Node.js 22 compatibility allowing CommonJS modules to import ESM modules with the `--module nodenext` flag.
  - **New `--module node18` Flag**: A stable flag for users fixed on Node.js 18, providing a reference that doesn't incorporate certain behaviors from `--module nodenext`.
  - **The `--erasableSyntaxOnly` Option**: Better compatibility with Node.js 23.6's experimental TypeScript support by ensuring TypeScript syntax can be easily erased.
  - **The `--libReplacement` Flag**: More control over TypeScript's behavior when replacing library files during compilation.
  - **Preserved Computed Property Names**: Better handling of computed property names in declaration files for more predictable emit.
  - **Performance Optimizations**: Improvements to program loads and updates, making builds and editor scenarios more responsive, especially for large projects.

- **Date**: 2024-11-22
- **Summary**: This release introduces several enhancements:

- **Path Rewriting for Relative Paths**: The new `--rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` compiler option allows TypeScript to rewrite relative import paths ending with TypeScript extensions to their corresponding JavaScript extensions during compilation.
- **Support for `--target es2024` and `--lib es2024`**: TypeScript 5.7 adds support for targeting ECMAScript 2024, including features like `Object.groupBy`, `Map.groupBy`, and `Promise.withResolvers`.
- **Searching Ancestor Configuration Files for Project Ownership**: The language service now continues searching for `tsconfig.json` files up the directory tree, allowing for more flexible project structures.
