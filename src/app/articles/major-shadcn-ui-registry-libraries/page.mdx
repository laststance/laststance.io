The [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) component library provides a rich set of basic components including Accordion, Alert, Dialog etc,

But what makes shadcn/ui truly powerful is its registry system. If you have a project with shadcn/ui already installed via `npx shadcn@latest init`, you can easily add components from third-party registries using commands like:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert --registry https://registry.example.com/components.json
```

This allows you to fetch individual components from various UI libraries distributed through the [shadcn/ui Registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) system.
