## Wrapping Up

December 2025 was a landmark month for Laststance. I launched two significant new projects (GitBox and Claude Plugin Dashboard), shipped multiple versions of our desktop apps (Signage and Complete), and strengthened security posture across all repositories.

The GitBox project represents our vision for a better GitHub repository management experience, while Claude Plugin Dashboard brings our expertise in developer tooling to the Claude Code ecosystem.
