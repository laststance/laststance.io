# Laststance Recap: January 2026

January 2026 was an incredibly productive month for Laststance! 🚀 We saw significant activity across **10+ active projects** with a total of **42 releases**, focusing heavily on improving developer experience, modernizing our tooling, and building new desktop applications. Key themes this month included Electron app development, E2E testing infrastructure improvements, and enhanced UI/UX across our products.

Let's dive into what we shipped this month!

## corelive

A real-time todo/task management application with web and Electron desktop support.

**Highlights:**

- [Implement drag-and-drop reordering for todos](https://github.com/laststance/corelive/commit/7ec9193327595f1cc26b1503866d78e7ebe98f07)

- [Migrate main process to TypeScript and add Settings with Hide App Icon](https://github.com/laststance/corelive/pull/14)
  - The Electron main process is now fully TypeScript, and users can hide the app icon from the dock for a cleaner desktop experience.
