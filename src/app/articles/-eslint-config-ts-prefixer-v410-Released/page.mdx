I just released **[eslint-config-ts-prefixer v4.1.0](https://github.com/laststance/eslint-config-ts-prefixer)**!

## 🧩 What Changed

Functionally, not much — the main change is that I **removed the Prettier rules**.
These days, tools like **Biome** and other formatters are becoming more common, so it made sense to keep ESLint focused on linting, not formatting.

## 📘 New Documentation Website

I also built a simple documentation site that explains each rule used in this config:
👉 [eslint-config-ts-prefixer Documentation](https://website-eslint-config-ts-prefixer.vercel.app/)

It includes descriptions and comments for every rule, so you can understand what each one does at a glance.

## 💡 About This Package

This config is something I originally made **for myself** — it’s a collection of rules I personally like to use in my projects.

That said, I especially recommend the **no-cycle rule**.
It’s super helpful for preventing **circular dependencies**, which can easily sneak into large TypeScript projects.

## 🗒️ Small Improvements

I’ve added **concise comments** to each rule inside the config file itself,
so when you open it, you can quickly see what the rule means in one line.

## 🙏 Final Thoughts

To be honest, I’m not really “into linting” — I don’t like spending too much time on it 😅
That’s why I made this package: to reuse a set of useful rules that work for me.

I’m not an ESLint professional, so there might be mistakes or better approaches.
If you notice anything, I’d love your **feedback or pull requests** on GitHub 💬
