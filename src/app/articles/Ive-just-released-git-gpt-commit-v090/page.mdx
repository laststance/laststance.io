Hey everyone! I'm thrilled to announce that [git-gpt-commit v0.9.0](https://github.com/laststance/git-gpt-commit) is now available! This AI-powered Git extension makes your commit process smoother by generating meaningful commit messages using OpenAI's GPT models.

## What's New in v0.9.0? ✨

This release comes with several exciting new features that make git-gpt-commit even more powerful:

### 🚀 Support for GPT-4o

The default model has been upgraded to OpenAI's GPT-4o, offering significantly improved message quality while maintaining fast response times. Your commit messages will be more accurate and contextually appropriate than ever!

### 🌐 Language Selection Command

```bash
git gpt lang
```

Choose from 12 languages for your commit messages, including English, Spanish, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Korean, Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Dutch, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese.

### 🏷️ Prefix Toggle Command

```bash
git gpt prefix
```

Easily toggle commit message prefixes (like `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.) on or off based on your team's conventions. No more manual formatting!

### 🔑 API Key Management

```bash
git gpt open-api-key
```

    height: 'auto',
  }}
/>
Securely add and manage your OpenAI API key directly through the CLI.
Previously, you had to set the API key in the `.env` file. That still working
fine!

### ⚙️ Configuration Management

```bash
git gpt config
```

View your current configuration settings in one place, making it easier to verify your preferences.

## How It Works

Simply stage your changes with `git add` as you normally would, then run:

```bash
git gpt commit
```

The tool analyzes your staged changes, sends them to the GPT model, and generates a contextually appropriate commit message. You can accept the suggestion or cancel the commit if you prefer to write your own message.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @laststance/git-gpt-commit
```

## Why git-gpt-commit?

I built this because while IDEs like VSCode and Cursor had AI-generated commit messages, there wasn't really a CLI tool for that—and I mostly use Git from the command line anyway. 😅

Happy committing! 🚀
